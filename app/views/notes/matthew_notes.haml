      %span.s1 Matthew 4: 1-11 Satan Tempts Jesus
    %p.p11 Why did Jesus have to go through a wilderness temptation?
    %p.p11 Three temptations:
    %p.p11 Bread while hungry (lust of the flesh or pleasure) (1 John 2:16)
    %p.p11 Testing God to protect him (pride)
    %p.p11 Rule over the kingdoms (lust of the eyes or power)

            %span.Apple-tab-span       Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.

      in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—is not of the Father but is of the world. 1 John 2:15-16 (or pleasure, power, and pride)
    %p.p11 Answer: “It is written”
    %p.p11 No matter the temptation/issue, the answer is always.. “what does God say about this?”
    %p.p11 Purpose: to humble Him and test His obedience

        %i not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men.

      %span.Apple-converted-space

    %p.p11 Having been lead by a pillar of cloud and fire, they still tempted the Lord that He might not provide for them, or that He was not with them (asked for water and threatened Moses)
    %p.p11
      %span.Apple-converted-space>  
      in the face of thirst without water, the Israelites tempted (tested) the Lord saying, “ Is the Lord among us or not?” V. 7
    %p.p11 What is the difference between trusting in the Lords’ protection, sovereignty and testing God?
    %p.p11 When we act in disobedience or recklessly without counsel or diligence (we are not to presume upon God)?
    %p.p11
      Trusting in “providence of God”
      %span.Apple-converted-space>  
      (or Romans 8:28) does not mean we always act, nor does it mean we always wait
      %span.Apple-converted-space

      “As Christ carries on war continually with various enemies, it is doubtless evident that he has no quiet possession of his kingdom. He is not, however, under the necessity of waging war; but it happens through his will that his enemies are not to be subdued till the last day, in order that we may be tried and proved by fresh exercises” ….”But as all the words are important, they must be examined a little more carefully.

        %span.s1 yet all his power to hurt us is destroyed or restrained
      It is a great consolation to know that we have to do with an enemy who cannot prevail against us. That what is here said has been said with regard to us, we may gather from the next clause,
      %i that he might destroy him that had the power of death;
      for the Apostle intimates that the devil was so far destroyed as he has power to reign to our ruin; for “the power of death” is ascribed to him from the effect, because it is destructive and brings death. He then teaches us not only that the tyranny of Satan was abolished by Christ’s death, but also that he himself was so laid prostrate, that no more account is to be made of him than as though he were not.”

    %p.p13
      %br/
    %p.p12
      Matthew’s gospel is not chronological and thus much has happened thus far as we proceed to Matt 5:

      The Messiah and King, Jesus has been baptized, overcome Satanic temptation and is now revealing himself for who he is.

      He has shown us his pattern of teaching, preaching and healing. We discussed how this is perhaps relevant to us as we are called to make disciples, share the gospel and to be ministers of mercy as the hands of Christ.

      %br/
    %p.p12 We discussed the absence of comment regarding their wives and families immediately coming along, although likely at times they may have been together. Many were likely married (1 Cor 9:5) and we know Jesus healed Peter’s mother in law early in His ministry (Mark 1: 29-34)

      We discussed how Jesus miracles served to “authenticate” His ministry (see Luke 7:18-22) as well to demonstrate His great compassion for suffering humanity.
      %span.Apple-converted-space  
    %p.p13
      %br/
    %p.p12 Finally, let us be mindful once again of the nature of the Kingdom of God (Kingdom of Heaven), that the “time is fulfilled” (Mark 1:15) in Jesus’ first advent, and that Jesus is going to proceed to teach about his kingdom as many will misunderstand its nature.

      %i did not come to abolish the Law.
      In these verses, we have seen how what the scribes and Pharisees were teaching through their oral tradition missed the meaning of the commandments. We saw that the commandments were mistakenly taught to be obeyed on the surface, but not in the heart. They had
      = succeed "." do
        %i neglected the weightier matters of the Law: justice and mercy and faith (Matt 23:23)
      Jesus further revealed how the commandments were misinterpreted and manipulated for personal benefit, and how the intent of the moral law (toward men) was always best summed up as “
      %i> love your neighbor
      ” even when your
      %i neighbor
      is your enemy. Ultimately, the law says,

      Of course, there is only one who has ever been perfect. No one can ever be justified by the Law, but we are justified when, by faith, we trust in the finished work of Christ. By grace, through faith, his righteousness can be ours, so that

      7._____ Works done by unregenerate men, although for the matter of them they may be things which God commands, and of good use both to themselves and others; yet because they proceed not from a heart purified by faith, nor are done in a right manner according to the word, nor to a right end, the glory of God, they are therefore sinful, and cannot please God, nor make a man meet to receive grace from God, and yet their neglect of them is more sinful and displeasing to God.

          %br
      The conclusion of the Lord's prayer, which is, For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever, Amen, teacheth us to take our encouragement in prayer from God only, and in our prayers to praise him, ascribing kingdom, power and glory to him. And in testimony of our desire, and assurance to be heard, we say, Amen.

    %p.p3 Always love your enemy (not necessarily forgive)
    %p.p3 No place for bitterness (Eph 4)
    %p.p3 Sometimes love allows guilt to remain with unrepentant (Matt 18:15-19)
    %p.p3 Love mercy (Micah 6:8)
    %p.p3 Use discernment in “Judging” the unrepentant sinner
    %p.p3 Does he/she understand? (“they know not what they do”)
    %p.p3 Have they been humbly confronted? Matt 18
    %p.p3 Forgiveness is Not commanded for unrepentant (Luke 17:3)
    %p.p3 Neither does God forgive the unrepentant (Matt 8:13, John 8:21, Luke 10:13, Acts 2:38, 3:19, etc.)

    %p.p3 like v.12
    %p.p3 Does this conditional statement suggest that our eternal forgiveness (our salvation) depends on our forgiveness of others? Yes and No
    %p.p3 This would overturn our eternal security based upon an event of unforgiveness (Rom 8:1, “no condemnation”, Eph 1:7, John 5:24, “believes has everlasting life”)
    %p.p3 Matt 18: perhaps suggests temporal (not eternal) chastisement/consequences (Heb 12:5-7)

    %p.p3 This passage has significant theological implications as it communicates the power of Christ to “bind” Satan. This is the exact same word used in Rev 20:2 to describe the state of Satan during the Millenium. (Post Mils and Amils believe that we are in the Millenium now) It implies a significant limitation to Satan’s activity or power. Before the first advent, Satan was ruling with little hindrance under God’s sovereign authority, and even after Satan has influence and sway, but not as before (2 Cor 4:4, 1 John 5:19)
